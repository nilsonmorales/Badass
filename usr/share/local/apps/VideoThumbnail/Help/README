VideoThumbnail
==============

This application can generate thumbnails of video files, for display
by ROX-Filer.  It requires: 

* ROX-Filer CVS 2003-10-13 or later, or verson 2.1.1

* ROX-Lib2 CVS 2003-11-08 or later, or version 1.9.12

* MPlayer 0.90 or later.

Installation
------------

To install it, copy to your ~/Apps directory (or /usr/local/apps or
/usr/apps) and run it.  Click on install handlers and click on OK.
You can choose not to install it for some of the types.

File type support
-----------------

Version 0.1.14 supports the following MIME types:

* video/mpeg
* video/quicktime
* video/x-matroska
* video/x-msvideo
* video/x-ms-wmv
* video/x-ms-asf
* video/x-ogm
* audio/x-pn-realaudio (which can be a video format)
* application/ogg
* application/x-flash-video
* application/x-matroska

It can also (in theory) support any file type that MPlayer can.  If
you find it works for more than those four please let me know.

Configuring
-----------

Running the program directly displays the options dialog.

* Install
   * Install type handlers - sets VideoThumbnail as the thumbnailer
                             for the types named above
   * Manage MIME type - set as handler for arbitrary types, see below
* General options
   * Back end - the program to use to generate the thumbnails
   * Thumbnail size - Best left at 128 pixels.  Ignored when called by
                      ROX-Filer which passes its own size.
* MPlayer options 
   * Draw sprocket effect - draws a film strip on the left and right of
                            the generated image
   * Sprocket size - size in pixels to make each sprocet image
   * Add time label - print the total length of the video file as 
                      H:MM:SS
   * Right align time label - controls whether the time label is at the top
                              left or top right
   * Use first frame - the first frame generated by MPlayer may be blank,
                       if so disable this option.
* Totem options
   * Scale image - whether Totem supports requesting non-standard 
                   pixel sizes

Manage MIME types
-----------------

This option shows a window where you may drop a sample file of any video type.
VideoThumbnail will then attempt to generate a thumbnail of that file.  If 
succesful you can then set VideoThumbnail as the thumbnail generator for that
file type.
