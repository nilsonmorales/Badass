#unlike BOOTCONFIG and PUPSTATE that are auto-generated by Puppy,
#MODULESCONFIG was manually created and can be edited.
#MODULESCONFIG is inserted into /sbin/pup_event_backend_d and pup_event_backend_modprobe.
#MODULESCONFIG is read/written by the BootManager (System menu).

#Please use underscore '_' in all module names, not '-'.

#PCI_OVERRIDES: if no match, or multiple matches, may need manual override...
#Put one entry on each line, using lower case a-f hex digits...
#Example: dmfe 0x00001282 0x00009102 #optional comment
#A module name of (none) prevents loading of any module for the hardware ID.
PCI_OVERRIDES='
(none) 0x0000127a 0x00004321 #Rockwell riptide modem not supported by driver

#SKIPLIST: may need to simply skip some modules...
#v2.15 suddenly occurred to me, what if oss and alsa sound modules both load?
# skip all pci oss... btaudio es1371 i810_audio kahlua trident via82cxxx_audio
#usbmouse, usbkbd are not needed if usbhid is loaded. ub is bad, messes up usb_storage.
#note, make sure SKIPLIST has space chars on the beginning and end.
#note, BootManager will read/write this variable.
#v403 note, rc.sysinit generates /tmp/pup_event_modprobe.conf from SKIPLIST, used in pup_event_backend_d.
#v431 took out 'ltserial'... 171212 took out 'nouveau'...

#ADDLIST: if a module did not get auto-loaded but you know it is required for
#your hardware, add it to this list. Note, BootManager will read/write this.
#an entry is allowed to have parameters, replace ' ' with ':'. ex: "mmc_block:major=179"
#note, list needs a space char at beginning and at end.

#PREFLIST: sometimes there are two hits, that is, two modules match the same
#'modalias' (that is, they are both claiming the same hardware). In such a case,
#here we can specify a preference. Each entry here is of the form
#'module1:module2' where module2 is the preferred choice.
#101218 format can have multiple ':', ex: 8139cp:8139too:8139xx (last is most preferred).
