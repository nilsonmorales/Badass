			ROX-Lib2
			Shared code for ROX applications
			by Thomas Leonard

Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~
Move the ROX-Lib2 directory inside ~/lib, /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib.

Programs which require ROX-Lib2 should now be able to find it. If you
want it somewhere else, set the LIBDIRPATH environment variable to a
colon separated list of directories to search for ROX-Lib2 and other
libraries.

Zero Install users don't have to do anything. Except for some very old
ones, programs will get it directly through Zero Install.


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is quite a lot of code which is needed by many ROX applications -- for
example: save boxes, menus and options.

Keeping all this code in one place makes these programs smaller. It also
makes programs which use it more consistant.

Programs which use ROX-Lib2 need to be able to find it, so you should put it
inside one of the standard library directories. If you don't have root
access, create a directory called 'lib' inside your home directory and move
ROX-Lib2 in there.

If you do have root access, move ROX-Lib2 into /usr/local/lib.


Developers
~~~~~~~~~~
For people wishing to write programs using this library, look in the
'ROX-Lib2/Help/python' directory.

There is also some on-line documentation here:

Translators
~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to translate ROX-Lib2 into your native language, follow
these steps (replace 'fr' with your language):

$ cd ROX-Lib2/Messages
$ ./update-po
$ cp ../python/rox/messages.pot fr.po
[ edit fr.po ]
$ ./dist

Updating an existing translation is the same, except you skip the 'cp' step.
